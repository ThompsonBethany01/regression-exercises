Regression Exercises Completed by Bethany Thompson in the Darden Codeup Cohort  
In this module:
- analyze, visualize and model various labeled datasets that are being stored in SQL
- have continuous target variables do supervised machine learning using regression on structured data
    - supervised machine learning (because the data is labeled)
    - regression (because the target variable we are analyzing is continuous)
    - structured data (because the data can be naturally stored in rows and columns).
